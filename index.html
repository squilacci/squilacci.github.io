        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Alex. I live and work in Stockholm. My job is to design user interfaces for web and different devices like iPhones and iPads. I've been living here since summer, but my current apartment rent ends soon and I need a new one. It would be very nice if your apartment becomes my new home! I'll receive a cozy home and you'll receive a good tenant or flatmate â€“ it's a typical "win-win" case. I am very well-behaved person. I don't make much noise and I don't smoke. I love sports, especially football and I go to the gym several times a week. I read and self-develop in my spare time. I don't speak Swedish yet, but I'm trying to learn it. Don't hesitate to ask me any questions if you have them.</p>
        <p>Please <a href="mailto:alexey.tretina@gmail.com">write me an email</a> if you're interested.</p>
        <p>Tack!</p>
