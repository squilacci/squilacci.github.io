        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is Alex. I live and work in Stockholm. My job is to design user interfaces for different devices like iPhones and iPads. I've been living here since summer, but my current apartment rent ends soon and I need a new one. It would be very nice if it's your apartment! I am well-behaved person. I don't make much noise and I don't smoke. I love sports, especially football and I go to the gym several times a week. I don't speak Swedish yet, but I'm trying to learn it. </p>
